The USDA Organic certification ensures a level of quality, and the omega fatty acids may support skin, coat, and general wellness.</p><p>However, this product contains hemp seed oil only. That means it lacks the full-spectrum cannabinoid profile needed to help with hip dysplasia. It's also missing third-party testing and doesn't clearly state how much to give, which can make consistent dosing difficult.</p><p>PB Pets is a fair pick for general wellness, but not ideal for dogs with serious problems like hip dysplasia.</p>"

Many reviewers mention improved behavior and fewer nervous habits.</p><p>That said, the product leaves a lot of questions unanswered.

Without a clear breakdown of cannabinoids or lab-backed quality, it's hard to know exactly what you're giving your dog.</p><p>It might help some dogs with general calmness, but it falls short for those needing targeted, therapeutic support or relief from pain.</p>"

With the added bonus of vitamins and fatty acids, it promises broad-spectrum support.</p><p>However, it lacks the certifications and clarity you'd expect from a premium hemp product. There's no visible Certificate of Analysis, and it's unclear whether the hemp oil contains cannabinoids or is simply derived from hemp seed. Some pet parents also report digestive sensitivity, likely due to the added ingredients.</p><p>Billion Pets may suit healthy dogs needing a wellness boost, but those with chronic conditions like hip dysplasia may do better with a purer, more transparent option.</p>"
