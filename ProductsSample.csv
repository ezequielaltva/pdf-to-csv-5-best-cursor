sleep, joint support)","● Made with hemp seed oil
● No published third-party lab tests

● Unclear dosing guidance for seizures","Billion Pets Hemp Oil is one of the most
budget-friendly options on Amazon, and it’s
marketed as an all-in-one solution for a
range of pet issues, including anxiety, joint
pain, and seizures. The formula includes
hemp seed oil and added nutrients, which
may help with general wellness.

However, it’s important to note that hemp
seed oil doesn’t contain the cannabinoids
found in full-spectrum hemp extract. Without
lab results, organic certification, or THC-free
guarantees, there’s no clear way to verify
quality or safety.

While it may provide some mild benefits for
overall coat or joint health, this product falls
short as a reliable option for seizure support.
Transparency and testing matter, and those
are missing here."

omega-rich formula that’s USDA Organic
and well-liked for everyday use. Many pet
parents report small improvements in stress
levels and coat shine, thanks to its
high-quality hemp seed base.

But when it comes to supporting dogs with
seizures, this product falls short. It doesn’t
contain any endocannabinoids, the
compounds that can help calm brain activity
and support the nervous system. There’s
also no certificate of analysis or lab
transparency, which makes it hard to gauge
what you’re really getting.

Overall, this oil might help with general
wellness, but it's not a dependable choice
for dogs dealing with seizures or more
serious neurological concerns."

wallet-friendly option that many dog owners
use to support stress relief and overall calm.
Reviews often mention a noticeable
difference in nervous energy or
restlessness, especially in younger or
high-strung dogs.

But when it comes to seizures or more
serious health concerns, this product raises
some concerns. There’s no mention of
full-spectrum hemp or active CBD content,
which means it may not offer the
compounds known to help with neurological
support. And without lab testing or
certification, there’s no way to confirm
what’s really inside.

It may work for mild stress or routine calm,
but it’s not a strong candidate for pet parents
seeking reliable seizure support or
clinical-grade quality."

high-strength option for pets dealing with
everything from seizures to arthritis. It
includes helpful nutrients like omegas and
claims to support calm, focus, and overall
comfort.

That said, the label leaves a lot of questions
unanswered. There's no clear proof of
full-spectrum content, no Certificate of

been vetted by veterinarians. The ingredient
list also includes vague components, which
could be problematic for sensitive pets.

It may offer general calming benefits, but if
you're dealing with serious neurological
issues like seizures, you’ll want a cleaner,
more transparent formula that’s backed by
third-party testing and vet trust."
